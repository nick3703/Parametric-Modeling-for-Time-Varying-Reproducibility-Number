#Date: Created 23 MAR 2020, Updated 1 APR 2020
#Purpose: This script estimates the daily effective reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 by US county. 

#Description: As described in Nishiura and Chowell (2009), R(t) is defined as the actual average # 
#of secondary cases per primary case at calendar time t. R(t) shows time-dependent variation due
#to the decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and the implementation of control 
#measures (extrinsic factors). If R(t) < 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and 
#may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t) > 1).

#The key equation in Nishiura and Chowell (2009) is (33), which uses daily incidence data 
#(i.e. using j_i incident cases infected between time t_i and time t_(i+1) and discretized a 
#generation time distribution w_i. As per Nishiura and Chowell (2009), generation time is
#the time from infection of a primary case to the infection of a secondary case by the primary 
#case. Given the novelty of COVID-19, the generation time distribution is currently unknown. 

#With this in mind, Zhao et al.'s (2020) "Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number 
#of novel coronavirus..." assumed the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) (the time 
#interval between infection and subsequent transmission) followed the MERS' SI distribution, which 
#was Gamma with mean=7.6 days and sd=3.4 days [as per (Assiri et al., 2013)]. Alternatively, Zhao et al.
#(2020) also posits a mean=8.4 days and sd=3.8 days, which corresponded to SARS [as per (Lipsitch et al., 
#2003)]. 

#Additionally, herd immunity (1-1/R0) is a function of estimates of R0. Thw papers were used to
#establish this range: "Estimation of the reproductive number of novel coronavirus..." (Zhang et al.),
#and "The reproductive number of COVID-19..." (Liu at al.). From these, we settled on a COVID-19 R0
#range of 2 to 3, implying herd immunity may be achieved at 50% to 67% of the population being exposed. 
#Furthermore, we used the ML estimate of 2.28 for R0 presented in (Zhang et al.) for our "best guess,"
#implying a "best guess" herd immunity level of 56.1%.

#UPDATES: 
#1 APR 2020: Nishiura, Lintona, and Akhmetzhanov's (2020) "Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections"
#provides a more extensive analysis of the generation time distribution. In their analysis, "the median
#serial interval of the best-fit Weibull distribution model was estimated at with a mean and SD of 4.8
#days and 2.3 days." This is important, as (1) "The difference between these distributions suggests that
#using serial intervals estimates from SARS data will result in overestimation of the COVID-19 basic reproduction 
#number," and (2) "the serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. 
#This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset."
